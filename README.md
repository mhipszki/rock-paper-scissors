# Rock-Paper-Scissors

The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie:

1. a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors: **rock crushes scissors**
- but will lose to one who has played paper: **paper covers rock**
- a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors **scissors cut paper**

If both players throw the same shape, the game is *tied* and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
