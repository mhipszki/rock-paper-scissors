# TODOS

- remove duplicate test examples in specs

- use array instead of object wrapper around symbol list

- symbol definition validator should explicitly check existence and type of `beats` property

- add outcome decorator to transform an outcome into a human readable message e.g. 0 => 'tie', 1 => 'A has beaten B'

- there must be at least 2 symbols defined in a real game, to have different outcomes i.e. a winner/loser or a tie
